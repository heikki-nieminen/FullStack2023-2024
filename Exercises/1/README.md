Exercise 1.1
Create an application like the one below. When an item on the list is selected and an arrow is clicked the selected item will be moved from one list to another. The list should contain string items that refer to someone’s first name.
When an item on the right side list is selected and the arrow (pointing to the left) is clicked the item shall be removed from the right side list and inserted to the left side list. 
When an item on the left side list is selected and the arrow (pointing to the right) is clicked the item shall be removed from the left side list and inserted to the right side list. 
If one of the 2 lists is empty the list should be replaced by text “This list has no items”.


Exercise 1.2
Change the design and let the user sort the items on each list. What seems to be the most typical way to communicate to the user that a list can be sorted? Please follow common guidelines for designing sortable lists if there are such guidelines.  

Exercise 1.3
Change the design in such a way that each list can be filtered. If the user enters “F” as filtering criteria, only the items starting with “F” should be listed. If the user enters “Fu” only the items starting with “Fu” should be listed.  Please follow common guidelines for designing filterable lists if they exist.    

Exercise 1.4
Change the design in such a way that uppercase and lowercase characters are considered equal as filtering criteria i.e. “Fu” and “fu” are considered equal. 

Exercise 1.5
Change the design in such a way that many items can be moved to the left or to the right in one click (of an arrow).  

Exercise 1.6
Change the design in such a way that there is no need for arrows to move the items to the left or to the right. How do you implement the requirement of exercise 1.5 in this case? 

Exercise 1.7
Material UI DataGrid component is among the most powerful components in the Material UI library. Check the documentation and consider if the previous requirements could be implemented by using a DataGrid component. If you have time, implement the requirements by using a DataGrid. https://material-ui.com/components/data-grid/.

Exercise 1.8
Add auto-complete feature to the filter. 


Good luck!
